He was managing a pizza place. He had two kids, my nephews. But after he lost his job he started dealing drugs. He didn\u2019t last two months in the streets. Benjamin thought the world was like our family; he was too trusting of people. And Detroit is a very dangerous place to be trusting of people. The Detroit Police Department did nothing: no leads, no investigation. It\u2019s like he wasn\u2019t even human. You can just murder people in that city. After his death I forgot about school. I dropped my classes, started drinking more, partying more. There was a lot of sex, a lot of meaningless sex. Nothing seemed to matter. It was dark. I was so angry at God, because how could he let that happen? But it\u2019s been four years now. And looking back\u2014if he hadn\u2019t been killed, so many other things don\u2019t happen. I\u2019d have never left Detroit. Benjamin was the one who always told me: \u2018You\u2019re special. You don\u2019t have to stay here.\u2019 But if he hadn\u2019t been killed, I\u2019d have never come to New York. And if I don\u2019t come to New York, I don\u2019t meet my best friend, which is my wife. Our wedding brought my whole family together for the first time since Benjamin\u2019s death. It was love and joy again. My mom walking me down the aisle, after losing her son. It just meant the world to her. And if I hadn\u2019t met my wife, we wouldn\u2019t have a son on the way. We\u2019re naming him Benjamin.\u201d",

And as soon as my work schedule stops, my mom schedule starts. I\u2019m on the way to pick them up right now. I know the bond is there. Oh my God; they\u2019re so attached to me. But I feel like they only get to see the strict mom, the military mom. The school is always asking us to do more academic things with them. So it\u2019s a lot of: let\u2019s do homework, let\u2019s read books. Then after that it\u2019s: we have to eat, we have to take a shower, we have to go to bed. And let\u2019s do it fast. Because you need to get to sleep. You need your rest, because we have so much to do tomorrow. I feel like what I\u2019m missing most, at this moment, is fun. There\u2019s no time for fun. I don\u2019t want them to only see me as a mother. I want them to see me as a friend, a best friend. Someone who will do crazy stuff with them. I heard that it might rain today. So I\u2019m hoping, really hoping, that we get caught in the rain today.\u201d",

I\u2019m here to support you. Then I have an edgelord older brother, who\u2019s all: \u2018I\u2019m a Satanist.\u2019 OK, Andrew. Let\u2019s calm down. My dad is more of a Mexican Catholic Guy. He just copes. He\u2019s really banking on the whole last rites thing, so he\u2019s kinda sorted. Honestly, I wish I was religious. At least they have something. Because for me it\u2019s like: \u2018Oh shit, there\u2019s nothing next.\u2019 And that doesn\u2019t sound nice. But ultimately life is just a series of chemical reactions, which is a depressing way of thinking about it. But I mean, I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s what\u2019s happening here. Even these thoughts\u2014they\u2019re just a series of chemical reactions, and one day the reactions end, and you can\u2019t think anymore. I don\u2019t even want to think about it. My therapist was like: \u2018You should really stop thinking about it.\u2019 I\u2019ve actually chilled out a lot from when I was at my worst. Here\u2019s something I use to comfort myself: ultimately my body is going to decay and I\u2019ll get recycled back into the earth, right? And maybe a mushroom will spring up from my body. That\u2019s a new form of something-or-other. And when the Earth finally comes to an end--my molecules will still be there, in some form. Just floating through the universe, forever. So that\u2019s nice, I guess. That\u2019s a comforting thought.\u201d",

I never had any boyfriends. I wanted affection. And for him to give me attention, it was like\u2014I wanted that. I did want it. I wanted him to look at me. I would dress for him. It makes me sick to think about now, but I would choose my clothes solely to make him look at me. I wanted him to say that I was pretty. I wanted his attention. And because I wanted it at first, you know\u2014I felt like I gave myself to this person willingly. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t report it for so many years. Because I felt like I was tempting him. He waited until I turned eighteen. And every time he abused me, he encouraged me to share the responsibility. He used the word \u2018we.\u2019 Always \u2018we.\u2019 He\u2019d say: \u2018We\u2019re not supposed to be doing this. You\u2019re making me do this. I don\u2019t want to, but you\u2019re making me do this.\u2019 Every time it was over, he\u2019d say: \u2018Now go to church and confess. Confess to tempting an older man.\u2019 I sued him last year, thanks to the Adult Survivors Act. I expected him to fight it tooth and nail; deny everything. But a couple days ago he sent a statement to my lawyer, basically apologizing for everything. When I got the letter, I thought of the child me. All I did in my mind was hug that child. It\u2019s like: you can forgive yourself now. There was never any \u2018we.\u2019 He knew you didn\u2019t have a father figure. He knew how you\u2019d respond to the attention. He knew how you\u2019d respond to the guilt, and the shame. He knew everything. It may have felt like you were choosing, but you weren\u2019t. You were chosen.\u201d",

        "text": "\u201cIt's a miracle I\u2019m even here. My father went through World War II: the Normandy Invasion, Omaha Beach. So for him to survive all that, and live long enough to become my father\u2014it\u2019s a miraculous thing. He died before I was eight years old. But it was enough time to experience him deeply. I was very loved, very welcomed, very cared for: my parents were thrilled I was their child. When I was younger I traveled quite a bit. Not every place, but a lot of places: Greece, Turkey, Alaska. And this wasn\u2019t just going on tours. It was real, vagabond stuff: no reservations, no plans. Just deeply experiencing another culture and another place. I\u2019ve gotten to do every kind of work, from agricultural labor to factory work. For twenty years I was a social worker with seniors. But I can\u2019t even call that a job, it was a service. I got to take care of people: bring them meals, help with housekeeping. It was an absolute calling. I was a workaholic. And now that I\u2019m retired-- I'm a play-aholic. There\u2019s nonstop free music in New York. I come to this park to listen to jazz piano. I go to Juilliard to listen to student recitals. There\u2019s going to be a Dixieland ragtime ensemble near Macy\u2019s. I mean, it\u2019s endless. I\u2019m just grateful for good health to enjoy it all. So many people wake up in pain. But I have my health, and I have a home. I mean, it\u2019s not a home. But I have a place. A safe place to rent. It\u2019s just been a blessed, beautiful life. The perfect life for me. I found it very, very rich. Very deep. And I think all of it was a blessing. All of it, miracles and blessings.\u201d",

But I try not to think about how long it\u2019s been. I\u2019ve read books about heroin addicts who changed their lives around twenty-six, so you know. I\u2019m still young. I just want to get back to my life. I\u2019m tired of waking up and needing it to not feel sick. I\u2019m tired of being homeless. I want to start talking to my family again; that\u2019s the biggest, I think. The not speaking to my parents. I missed my mom\u2019s birthday. And my sister\u2019s birthday; just two days ago. I really am blessed with a good family. I mean, my parents were strict; but I can\u2019t blame that anymore. I\u2019ve been trying to figure out the source of it. I think part of me just wanted to try everything. You know: what\u2019s it like? But I think there was another part of me that wanted the attention, I guess. Something I could do so that people would like, ask me: are you ok? Some way to share the pain. I tried to kill myself once, when I was fourteen. I don\u2019t know; I had such a good life. I was just so mad at myself for being so sad.\u201d",

I was so bad at school that I acted like a clown just to avoid everything; then I got caught running around here with a pistol when I was thirteen. They sent me to Tryon Juvenile Detention Center, and that\u2019s where I met Ms.Lakewood. She taught the computer class. Heavy-set Italian lady, about 4\u2019 10\u201d.But attitude, huge. Aura, big. She was like the grandmother in a mob movie. You know how you\u2019ve got all the bosses, but when the grandmother comes in\u2014everyone shuts up? She was like that. But she was loving too. She had pictures on the wall of all her favorite students; she called them her babies. She even had a picture of Mike Tyson up there. He was one of her babies. One day we had this contest, on the computer. The winner got $50. And I was looking at the screen and getting so angry. I\u2019m crying, because I couldn\u2019t read. And that\u2019s when thisSpanish kid called me Forrest Gump. He had the whole class laughing at me. MissLakewood was like: \u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019 She came over to me and said: \u2018Fix your face. Fix your fucking face, I don\u2019t want to see another tear.\u2019 Then she said:\u2018Tomorrow, you better get ready.\u2019 She started working with me for an hour-and-a-half, every night. She started me on Lion King. It was a preschool book, so I didn\u2019t want to do it. But she made me. Every night she made me keep reading until I was able to read on my grade level. I started getting report cards with nothing less than 85. I was sending them home; my mom was getting hyped. I got my GED. I started reading so much. Today I can finish a five-hundred-page book in two days. If I smoke a blunt first, I swear to God I can picture the whole book like it\u2019s a movie. Miss Lakewood passed away when I was eighteen. I heard about it while I was in prison. Some new guys came in; they\u2019d been in Tryon too. They heard me talking about her and that\u2019s when one of them told me. But he said: \u2018Yo. I\u2019m pretty sure she had your picture on the wall.\u2019\u201d",

        "text": "\u201cI was seventeen. Only child, not a lot of friends. But I had a plan. I was going to become an actress, get a role on All My Children, meet my husband on set-- and when that was all over\u2014I\u2019d host a talk show. Kelly Ripa did it; I could do it too. Back then it seemed like every woman on television had gotten their start as beauty queen. So my senior year I decided to enter my school\u2019s Homecoming Queen competition. It was organized like a Ms. America pageant. But this was a rough high school, only one other girl signed up-- so I had a good shot. My whole family got behind me. My mom was a seamstress. We noticed that in most pageants we watched, the winner wore a white dress. So she sewed me a white dress that I picked out of Seventeen Magazine. First came the interview portion, and that\u2019s when the trouble started. The judges asked me about the Anita Hill testimony; I wasn\u2019t ready for that. I was ready for world peace. They were supposed to ask me about my goals, so I could say world peace. But that didn\u2019t happen. The talent portion was later that night at the homecoming dance. The whole school was there. I chose a Sheena Easton song; poor choice. Not the right crowd for that. The other girl chose \u2018I Feel Good\u2019 by Stephanie Mills, and she had the whole crowd singing along. That\u2019s when I knew it was over. But then, a miracle. The guidance counselor quieted everyone down, and announced the winner: it was me. Me! It was my Kelly Kapowski moment. Everyone was cheering, the other girl congratulated me. But it only lasted five seconds, because the guidance counselor said: \u2018Wait a second, I\u2019m sorry. Joanna is the runner-up.\u2019 It was the worst moment of my life. In fact, the only thing that got me through COVID was knowing that it could not possibly, possibly be worse than that moment. And here\u2019s a twist for you. Remember that guidance counselor? Several years later I ended up acting alongside his son in a play at Queens College. In one scene I pulled a gun on him, and the director was like: \u2018We need more anger. Think about something that makes you angry.\u2019 I was like: \u2018Well, that\u2019s easy. His father ruined my senior year. And quite possibly, my entire life.\u201d",

        "text": "\u201cPeople see it as a fake sport. Whenever you tell someone you play Ultimate, it\u2019s like: oh, is that where you throw a frisbee in a basket? Or is that the one where you throw it to a dog? Whenever I\u2019m talking to someone about it, I just hope they\u2019ll ask me enough questions so that I can talk about UNC Ultimate. That was probably the most special experience I'm ever going to have in my whole life. I was on the team for five years, then I came back and coached. My freshman year we were really, really bad. But at the moment UNC Chapel Hill is triple back-to-back-to-back national champions. And I got to be part of that trajectory. But even though the team kept getting better and better, I kinda stayed at the same level. I never became the elite player that I wanted to be. I have a lot of \u2018stick-to-it-ive-ness.\u2019 I\u2019m capable of working really, really hard. And part of me always believed that would be enough, which is the part that burned me out. Because after working so hard, for so long, I reached a plateau. It was physical stuff. I'm just not quick enough. When I play defense I can\u2019t keep up with the fastest offensive handlers. They're going to score, and that's a problem. I ended up getting cut from the elite women\u2019s club team I was on. I switched over to mixed, but ended up tearing my ACL a couple years ago. It\u2019s been my life for ten years, but now I\u2019m at a place where I don't know if I'm ever going to play again. I just don\u2019t know if my body can handle it. I don't want to have another, like massive orthopedic surgery. And frisbee takes up so much bandwidth; there\u2019s so many other things I want to explore. The list is infinitely long. I\u2019m asking myself: could I be happy playing on a mid-level team where the commitment wouldn't be quite as high? Or will I only feel satisfied if I'm exceptional? That\u2019s an unhealthy connection I have in my head, I think. That love is something you need to earn. And being exceptional will make me worthy of having connections with people. It would be great to become a version of myself where I no longer feel that way. And maybe we'll get there someday. We\u2019re working on it. In the meantime, at least I got to talk about UNC Ultimate.\u201d",

I\u2019m a lot more mature than most fourteen-year-olds; I already have a job and everything. But she\u2019ll shut me down just to get at me. And there\u2019s nothing I can do because she\u2019s my Mom. She\u2019s always on top of me: be careful with this, be careful with that. Won\u2019t let me go to my friend\u2019s houses if they\u2019re a little further than our neighborhood. And we\u2019re both stubborn, so if I try to argue it goes back and forth. She doesn't want to see her kid be right. She gives me no choice but to be loud and extreme just to get my point across. But look, I get it. She\u2019s got this Google folder on her phone with like 1400 photos of me when I was younger. It goes all the way back to my first day of school. The other day I went into the kitchen to get a drink, and I caught her scrolling through the pictures, and she's crying. I was like damn. So look-- I get it. I\u2019m still mad, but I get it.\u201d",

There was a big song on the radio back then, about gettin\u2019 married. Everybody was singing it, something about: \u2018When we get married, we gonna have a celebration.\u2019 You keep hearing it every day, and you wanna try it too. Never thought it would last this long. It\u2019s been a good ride though. Everybody has a little bump here and there. We had our arguments, and I ain\u2019t never did win one. Ain\u2019t no man ever gonna win when it comes down to arguing with your wife. You could be married for a hundred years, she\u2019s gonna have the last word. So no need to get your mouth all rolled up. Don\u2019t stand there arguing and cursing. Just listen, laugh, and let it go. Kiss her on the cheek and say: \u2018you the winner.\u2019 After that, everything will be beautiful.\u201d",

Everybody needs a welcome from somebody else so that they can feel useful. It\u2019s a real source of energy. And when you realize you\u2019re not getting that as much\u2014what happens is you get scared. And you also say: maybe we could do something a little different. So at some point we came up with the idea of the cute older couple. We were hoping to find some younger friends. We\u2019ve always been attracted to younger people. You know, young people struggle. So we like to support them and wish them well and give them a lot of approval. And young people need cute old couples. They love cute old couples. So we decided to play it up a little bit. That\u2019s what it is: \u2018play.\u2019 It\u2019s really play. Have you ever seen two dogs greet each other? One dog will drop down, and bam, suddenly they\u2019re playing. I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re inviting a play response.\u201d",

        "text": "\u201cOccasionally I\u2019ll have a beer after work and break out the sketchbook. But I had wanted to be this great painter. I wanted to do these grand things: big, huge oil paintings. But those days of painting all the time were such a roller coaster. There were these periods of extreme depression, followed by manic states of trying to put myself out there. I couldn\u2019t do it anymore. I mainly felt sorry for my dad. I know it was rough for him. My mom hadn\u2019t wanted me to go to art school. She wanted me to do something more practical, but my dad said: \u2018No. This is what he wants to do, and I want to support his dream.\u2019 And then I abandoned it. That was the first time I had to deal with real failure. A lot of times when you\u2019re an artist\u2014it\u2019s your job, it\u2019s your lifestyle, it\u2019s your entire fucking identity. It wasn\u2019t like I failed to do a thing. It was like: I failed to be something, you know? It was a failure to live up to what I thought was my destiny. But then on the other side of that-- there was this figuring out that there was nothing wrong with me the entire time. I didn\u2019t need to be something else to have meaningful friendships, or a good relationship. I didn\u2019t need to be something else to be loved and cared about. After work tonight I\u2019m going to meet up with a person who\u2019s in love with me, and I can\u2019t wait. And that person met me long after I gave up on being a full-time artist. They met me when I wasn\u2019t even a chef yet. I was a piss-poor, part-time line cook. But even then-- they decided I was worth it. So you know, there\u2019s something there. There\u2019s something there that\u2019s enough.\u201d",

Back when their spouses were still alive, the four of them had been great friends. They would double date together. And when their spouses passed away\u2014the two of them became a thing. Every day she would come over for lunch. I\u2019d always cook a little meal for them. I\u2019d prepare the table; I\u2019d lay out my little candles and my little flowers. As soon as she arrived I\u2019d put on music and dim the lights, then I\u2019d leave the room and go wait in the bedroom. They would cuddle and snuggle. And the beauty of it was\u2014even though he couldn\u2019t control his fluids at that point, she never minded the smell. Her love for him was so great that they would still kiss and all that good stuff. When the doctors said that it was time for him to go to hospice, he said he didn\u2019t want to go. He told them that he wanted to come back home and die with me. I was with him in the end. My patients never die alone. Never, ever. One week after his passing I was hired by his girlfriend\u2019s family. She had terminal Alzheimer\u2019s, and I ended up staying with her for seven years. I fell in love with her. We were family, just family. She used to be a tap dancer. We\u2019d sing together. And if she didn\u2019t feel like singing, I\u2019d sing. Even near the end, she always knew when something was wrong with me. When I wasn\u2019t being the Gabby that she knew-- she would always know. When the doctors said it was time for her to go to hospice, her children said: \u2018We want her to die with Gabby.\u2019 In the final days she wouldn\u2019t eat, she\u2019d lock her jaw. But she would always eat for me. One night I could see the fright in her eyes, and I knew it was time. My patients never die alone. Never, ever. So I climbed under the covers with her. And she passed away in my arms.\u201d",

She\u2019d give me a hug afterward, tell me I was the best dad ever. We were such good friends. But now it feels like we\u2019re so far apart. She doesn\u2019t want to talk to me anymore. Even when she\u2019s upset, she\u2019ll ignore me and go to her room. It\u2019s like: C\u2019mon. I was fifteen too. I know what it\u2019s like. But she\u2019ll come back, I know that. They always come back. But it does feels like you\u2019re getting your heart ripped out a little bit.  But look, I get it. She\u2019s figuring out life. You have to back off. You have to give them space. Cause if you charge after them and get all aggressive about it, you might push them away forever. But they always come back, right? One day she\u2019s gonna realize that I\u2019m not the enemy and I\u2019m really her dad, her friend. I still get a flicker of it, every once in awhile. We had a really surreal moment last year. Her birthday is March 17th. She\u2019s a St. Paddy\u2019s Day birthday. We always take her to a Spanish restaurant on Long Island, but this time we did something special. Her uncle used to be a bodyguard for Taylor Swift, and we still know some people at the company. So they got us tickets to her concert. Fifth row seats. I mean, don\u2019t get me wrong. We paid for them-- but fifth row center. She was crying. I got a big hug. A big kiss. A \u2018Thank you, Dad.\u2019 It wasn\u2019t \u2018You\u2019re the best dad ever.\u2019 But it was a really big: \u2018Thank you, Dad.\u2019\u201d",

You have to wake up at this time. You have to go do this. You have to go do that. It\u2019s like I didn\u2019t have any originality. There was a certain point when I realized that everything-- this whole routine that I had, had been given to me by other people. And the weird thing is\u2014whenever you try to remove yourself from that equation, and stop doing what other people want, you kind of get ostracized and outcast. That\u2019s kinda what happened to me. I have a great family, but it\u2019s full of strong personalities. I had so many people telling me: do this, do that. They said it was a \u2018respect\u2019 thing. You know: \u2018I\u2019m the adult, so you should respect me.\u2019 But I never understood that. Because at what age do I get this thing called respect? Nobody in my family could ever answer that question. Is it when I have a kid? Is that it? Or is it when I'm paying a certain amount of bills? At what point do I step up on the pedestal?\u201d",

        "text": "\u201cThe question everybody wants to know is: why don\u2019t the aliens contact us if they're really here? The answer is simple: because it would melt your psyche to contact beings from another dimension. Whether it's ghosts or spirits or deceased relatives or past lives or future lives or aliens or Bigfoot or fairies, all of it will melt your psyche. Because you\u2019ve been programmed by The Empire to believe those things don\u2019t exist. Unless of course you\u2019re an indigenous person raised on traditional shamanic ceremonies. I learned all this by talking to other humans on other earths in other universes, so I'm trying to not blow your mind right now. When you\u2019re talking about other dimensions you have to use a lot of metaphors\u2014so just imagine earth as North Korea. You\u2019ve probably seen enough documentaries to know what's going on in North Korea. The North Korean people are completely mind locked and brainwashed, and they have a completely inaccurate understanding of the rest of the planet. Well, that\u2019s the same thing that\u2019s happening here. Earth is the North Korea of the multiverse.\u201d",
